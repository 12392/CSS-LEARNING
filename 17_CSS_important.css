div{
    border: 1px solid red !important;
}

div{
    border: 1px solid green;
}

/* As we can see above it will show the border of green color
due to order */

/* And if we use the inline css then inline will show as inline has
the highest property */

/* but if we want to use red border and it not comes in priority
then we can use !important it will make it as a highest priority */

/* if every element you define have important then it follow the same rule 
of normal priority */

/* use as less as much you can it is not a good practice to use important */
